Login is done using an email and password, with an option to reset passwords if needed. 
Only registered clients can purchase tickets, order food or cancel tickets. Administrators have the authority to add, 
remove, or modify movie listings, schedule showtimes, and add/remove new projection rooms. The workers are able to 
see and make users' reservations and cancellations, but they can't manage the movies.


2. The system provides a list of currently available movies to the clients, displaying details such as title, 
genre, duration, rating, and description. Showtimes for each movie are listed along with available 
seats, and users can filter movies based on genre, language, or showtime.

vary based on seat type, including standard, premium, and VIP. Multiple tickets can be booked

portion sizes and toppings where applicable. Payments for online food orders are processed along

availability. If a user calls the cinema, a worker will respond, and they will buy or cancel the user's 
ticket.

these. The system ensures efficient tracking of ticket sales and food orders, allowing administrators
