### First sprint
We firstly decided what the project was going to be about, and then we wrote altogether the
wording of it. Each member provided new ideas that where discussed and added.

Then, we divided the project into tasks and assigned them to each member; as some of the tasks
were more demanding than others, we tried to balance the workload by assigning two members to those tasks.

All of us worked concurrently on the requirements' analysis and gave feedback to each other via GitHub's
project issues. After being on the same page, we started coding the first prototype of the main menu.
