### My role

This project was developed as a team assignment for the Software Engineering course at UPV/EHU.
As part of the team, I took on the role of Scrum Master, coordinating the team's workflow and ensuring timely progress.

In addition, I actively contributed to all areas of development, from the backend API integration and business logic, to the user interface implementation and testing.
This hands-on approach allowed me to gain experience in the full software development cycle, collaborating closely with my teammates.
