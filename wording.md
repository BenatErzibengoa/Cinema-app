1- Users must register and log in to access the system. Login is done using an email and password, with an option to reset passwords if needed. Only registered users can purchase tickets or order food. Administrators have the authority to add, remove, or modify movie listings and schedule showtimes.

2- The system provides a list of currently available movies, displaying details such as title, genre, duration, rating, and description. Showtimes for each movie are listed along with available seats, and users can filter movies based on genre, language, or showtime.

3- Users can select a movie, preferred showtime, and available seats for booking. Ticket prices vary based on seat type, including standard, premium, and VIP.

Upon successful booking, users receive a confirmation email or message.

The system ensures efficient tracking of ticket sales and food orders, allowing administrators to generate revenue reports and monitor food inventory to prevent shortages.

8- After watching a movie, users can provide ratings and reviews, offering feedback on both the movie and their overall cinema experience. This feedback helps administrators analyze user preferences and improve the service accordingly.
